class BaseContactForm(forms.Form):
    """
    Base contact form class from which all contact form classes should
    inherit.
    
    If you don't need any custom functionality, you can simply use
    this form to provide basic contact functionality; it will collect
    name, email address and message.
    
    To add functionality, subclass this form; most of the heavy
    lifting happens in the ``get_message`` method, which must exist on
    all subclasses and which must return a dictionary with the
    following keys:

        * ``subject``: A string to use as the subject of the message.
        
        * ``recipient_list``: A list of email addresses to which
          the message should be sent.
          
        * ``message``: A string to use as the message body.

    If all you want to add in your subclass is extra validation,
    leaving the base ``get_message`` alone will work, and will return
    the following:

        * ``subject``: The name of the current ``Site`` in square
          brackets, followed by "Message sent through the web site".

        * ``recipient_list``: The email addresses specified in the
          ``MANAGERS`` setting.

        * ``message``: The output of rendering the template
          ``contact/base_contact_form.txt`` with the values of the
          ``name``, ``email`` and ``message`` fields.

    If a subclass defines ``__init__``, it must call this form's
    ``__init__`` via ``super``, and it must accept ``*args`` and
    ``**kwargs`` and pass them in the ``super`` call.
    
    Beyond that, the sky's the limit; anything which is supported by
    Django's newforms can be added in a subclass.
